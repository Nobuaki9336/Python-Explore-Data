## Overview
This repository contains my Jupyter notebook which showcases the data analysis skills. The notebook includes practical applications of libraries such as NumPy, pandas, and Matplotlib.

## Project Description
In the project, you'll find various exercises that demonstrate my ability to manipulate, analyze, and visualize data. Here's what you can expect:

- **Data Cleaning**: Techniques for handling missing data, removing duplicates, and correcting data types.
- **Data Manipulation**: Use of pandas to sort, filter, and aggregate data.
- **Data Analysis**: Insights derived from exploratory data analysis.
- **Data Visualization**: Charts and plots created with Matplotlib to illustrate data trends and patterns.
- **Numerical Computations**: Implementation of complex mathematical operations with NumPy.
